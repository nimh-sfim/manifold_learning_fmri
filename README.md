# Manifold Learning for fMRI

This repository contains the code of a manuscript in preparation evaluating the applicability of different manifold learning methods to fMRI data.

Information about software requirements and how to run this code can be found on the [project wiki](../../wiki).

To explore the data and create figures, we created web-based dashboards using panel and other holoviz libraries. 

See below a stand-alone, stripped version of one of these dashboards below. The environment takes a couple of minutes to load, but then the app will run smoothly in your browser.
