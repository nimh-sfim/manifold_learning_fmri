# Manifold Learning for fMRI

This repository contains the code of a manuscript in preparation evaluating the applicability of different manifold learning methods to fMRI data.

Information about software requirements and how to run this code can be found on the [project wiki](../../wiki).

To explore the data and create figures, we created web-based dashboards using panel and other holoviz libraries. 

To access a stand-alone, limited version of one of these dashboards, please click [here](https://nimh-sfim.github.io/manifold_learning_fmri/Demo_Embedding_Dashboard_standalone.html)
